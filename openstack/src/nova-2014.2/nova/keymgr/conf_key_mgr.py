"""
An implementation of a key manager that reads its key from the project's
configuration options.

This key manager implementation provides limited security, assuming that the
key remains secret. Using the volume encryption feature as an example,
encryption provides protection against a lost or stolen disk, assuming that
the configuration file that contains the key is not stored on the disk.
Encryption also protects the confidentiality of data as it is transmitted via
iSCSI from the compute host to the storage host (again assuming that an
attacker who intercepts the data does not know the secret key).

Because this implementation uses a single, fixed key, it proffers no
protection once that key is compromised. In particular, different volumes
encrypted with a key provided by this key manager actually share the same
encryption key so *any* volume can be decrypted once the fixed key is known.
