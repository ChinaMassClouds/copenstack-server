        Note that because of the poor design of the
        `glance.ImageService.download` method, the function returns different
        things depending on what arguments are passed to it. If a data argument
        is supplied but no dest_path is specified (only done in the XenAPI virt
        driver's image.utils module) then None is returned from the method. If
        the data argument is not specified but a destination path *is*
        specified, then a writeable file handle to the destination path is
        constructed in the method and the image bits written to that file, and
        again, None is returned from the method. If no data argument is
        supplied and no dest_path argument is supplied (VMWare and XenAPI virt
        drivers), then the method returns an iterator to the image bits that
        the caller uses to write to wherever location it wants. Finally, if the
        allow_direct_url_schemes CONF option is set to something, then the
        nova.image.download modules are used to attempt to do an SCP copy of
        the image bits from a file location to the dest_path and None is
        returned after retrying one or more download locations (libvirt and
        Hyper-V virt drivers through nova.virt.images.fetch).

        I think the above points to just how hacky/wacky all of this code is,
        and the reason it needs to be cleaned up and standardized across the
        virt driver callers.
