Image cache class

Images that are stored in the cache folder will be stored in a folder whose
name is the image ID. In the event that an image is discovered to be no longer
used then a timestamp will be added to the image folder.
The timestamp will be a folder - this is due to the fact that we can use the
VMware API's for creating and deleting of folders (it really simplifies
things). The timestamp will contain the time, on the compute node, when the
image was first seen to be unused.
At each aging iteration we check if the image can be aged.
This is done by comparing the current nova compute time to the time embedded
in the timestamp. If the time exceeds the configured aging time then
the parent folder, that is the image ID folder, will be deleted.
That effectively ages the cached image.
If an image is used then the timestamps will be deleted.

When accessing a timestamp we make use of locking. This ensure that aging
will not delete an image during the spawn operation. When spawning
the timestamp folder will be locked  and the timestamps will be purged.
This will ensure that a image is not deleted during the spawn.
