    # Think these two state before upgrading:
    #
    # (A) address 'x' is duplicate
    #     bm_nodes.prov_mac_address='x'
    #     bm_interfaces.address=['x', 'y']
    #
    # (B) no address is duplicate
    #     bm_nodes.prov_mac_address='x'
    #     bm_interfaces.address=['y']
    #
    # Upgrading them results in the same state:
    #
    #     bm_nodes.prov_mac_address='x'
    #     bm_interfaces.address=['x', 'y']
    #
    # Downgrading this results in B, even if the actual initial status was A
    # Of course we can change it to downgrade to B, but then we cannot
    # downgrade to A; it is an exclusive choice since we do not have
    # information about the initial state.
