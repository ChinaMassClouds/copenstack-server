    The VFS class defines an interface for manipulating files within
    a virtual disk image filesystem. This allows file injection code
    to avoid the assumption that the virtual disk image can be mounted
    in the host filesystem.

    All paths provided to the APIs in this class should be relative
    to the root of the virtual disk image filesystem. Subclasses
    will translate paths as required by their implementation.
