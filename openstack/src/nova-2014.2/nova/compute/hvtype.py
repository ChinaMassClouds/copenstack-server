"""Constants and helper APIs for dealing with virtualization types

The constants provide the standard names for all known guest
virtualization types. This is not to be confused with the Nova
hypervisor driver types, since one driver may support multiple
virtualization types and one virtualization type (eg 'xen') may
be supported by multiple drivers ('XenAPI' or  'Libvirt-Xen').
