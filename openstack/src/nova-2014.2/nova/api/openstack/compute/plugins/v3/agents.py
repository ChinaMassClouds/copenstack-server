    """The agent is talking about guest agent.The host can use this for
    things like accessing files on the disk, configuring networking,
    or running other applications/scripts in the guest while it is
    running. Typically this uses some hypervisor-specific transport
    to avoid being dependent on a working network configuration.
    Xen, VMware, and VirtualBox have guest agents,although the Xen
    driver is the only one with an implementation for managing them
    in openstack. KVM doesn't really have a concept of a guest agent
    (although one could be written).

    You can find the design of agent update in this link:
    http://wiki.openstack.org/AgentUpdate
    and find the code in nova.virt.xenapi.vmops.VMOps._boot_new_instance.
    In this design We need update agent in guest from host, so we need
    some interfaces to update the agent info in host.

    You can find more information about the design of the GuestAgent in
    the following link:
