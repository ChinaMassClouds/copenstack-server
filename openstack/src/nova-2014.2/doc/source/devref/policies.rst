Development policies
--------------------

Out Of Tree Support
===================

While nova has many entrypoints and other places in the code that allow for
wiring in out of tree code, upstream doesn't actively make any guarantees
about these extensibility points; we don't support them, make any guarantees
about compatibility, stability, etc.

APIs
=====

Follow the guidelines set in: https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/APIChangeGuidelines

The canonical source for API behavior is the code *not* documentation.
Documentation is manually generated after the code by folks looking at the
code and writing up what they think it does, and it is very easy to get
this wrong.

This policy is in place to prevent us from making backwards incompatible
changes to APIs.

Patches and Reviews
===================

Merging a patch requires a non-trivial amount of reviewer resources.
As a patch author, you should try to offset the reviewer resources
spent on your patch by reviewing other patches. If no one does this, the review
team (cores and otherwise) become spread too thin.

For review guidelines see: https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/ReviewChecklist

Reverts for Retrospective Vetos
===============================

Sometimes our simple "2 +2s" approval policy will result in errors.
These errors might be a bug that was missed, or equally importantly,
it might be that other cores feel that there is a need for more
discussion on the implementation of a given piece of code.

Rather than `an enforced time-based solution`_ - for example, a patch
couldn't be merged until it has been up for review for 3 days - we have
chosen an honor-based system where core reviewers would not approve
potentially contentious patches until the proposal had been
sufficiently socialized and everyone had a chance to raise any
concerns.

Recognising that mistakes can happen, we also have a policy where
contentious patches which were quickly approved should be reverted so
that the discussion around the proposal can continue as if the patch
had never been merged in the first place. In such a situation, the
procedure is:

0. The commit to be reverted must not have been released.
1. The core team member who has a -2 worthy objection should propose a
   revert, stating the specific concerns that they feel need
   addressing.
2. Any subsequent patches depending on the to-be-reverted patch may
   need to be reverted also.
3. Other core team members should quickly approve the revert. No detailed
   debate should be needed at this point. A -2 vote on a revert is
   strongly discouraged, because it effectively blocks the right of
   cores approving the revert from -2 voting on the original patch.
4. The original patch submitter should re-submit the change, with a
   reference to the original patch and the revert.
5. The original reviewers of the patch should restore their votes and
   attempt to summarize their previous reasons for their votes.
6. The patch should not be re-approved until the concerns of the people
   proposing the revert are worked through. A mailing list discussion or
   design spec might be the best way to achieve this.
